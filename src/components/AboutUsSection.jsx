            Eduaid-SL was founded by a group of passionate educators and students who understand the
            challenges faced by learners in Sierra Leone. We aim to bridge the gap in educational
            resources and provide accessible, high-quality support to all students.

          <p className="mb-6">
            In Sierra Leone, many students struggle to access quality educational materials,
            especially in rural areas. Eduaid-SL was created to address this issue by offering a
            platform where students can find free resources, tutorials, and guidance to excel in
            their studies.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Our platform provides a wide range of resources, including past exam papers, study
            guides, video tutorials, and study tips. Whether you're preparing for WASSCE, NPSE, or
            BECE, Eduaid-SL is here to help you every step of the way.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            We believe that education is the key to unlocking opportunities and transforming lives.
            By empowering students with the right tools and knowledge, we aim to contribute to the
            development of Sierra Leone and create a brighter future for all.
